Ciphering feature:
This feature should accept a ciphered string and return it deciphered.

The cipher will be stored in a file named key.txt, stored in a folder, ciphers.
(in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.)

This file will contain two lines:
    - the first line is the actual letter.
    - the second line is the cipher match.

When the cipher is accessed, it must be validated.

Example:

A cipher that shifts by a letter.

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
